# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Silent failures must become visible failures — errors surface to developers and users
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — error-visibility

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (error-visibility) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 6min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-error-visibility | 1/2 | 6min | 6min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Error handling + null safety merged into Phase 1 (both address "code fails visibly, not silently")
- Roadmap: Concurrency before splitting (fix races in original locations before moving code)
- Roadmap: Tests after splitting (test the refactored modules, not the pre-split monoliths)
- [Phase 01]: AppLogger uses println-based output with severity prefix for KMP compatibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Build/test commands run externally by the user, not in this session
